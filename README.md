# Multinomial Logistic Regression with scikit-learn

## Project Overview

This project explores Multinomial Logistic Regression for multiclass classification while trying to address severe class imbalance. The objective is to evaluate different techniques, like class weighting, oversampling with SMOTE, One-vs-Rest (OvR), and Bayesian Optimization, on a weather dataset with three target classes:   
- No Precipitation
- Rain
- Snowfall

## Data
The dataset consists of historical weather parameters obtained via the Open-Meteo API and will serve as the foundation for evaluating different ML algorithms in a multi-class classification setting.

## Project Structure

The project consists of notebooks, each focusing on a specific phase of the workflow:

01 - Introduction – Overview of the problem and objectives.   
02 - Basic EDA – Data exploration, class distribution, feature analysis.   
03 - Logistic Regression Essentials – Theoretical background on multinomial logistic regression.   
04 - Standard Logistic Regression – Baseline model without imbalance handling.   
05 - Weighted Logistic Regression – Using class_weight to handle imbalance.   
06 - SMOTE Logistic Regression – Addressing imbalance with synthetic oversampling.   
07 - OvR Logistic Regression – Handling multiclass classification via One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategy.   
08 - Bayesian Optimization – Fine-tuning hyperparameters with Bayesian Optimization (BayesSearchCV).   
09 - Model Comparison & Final Thoughts – Evaluation, confusion matrices, conclusions, and future work.

## Key Findings
A consistent trade-off between precision and recall across all logistic regression iterations was observed and finaly
all failed to handle class imbalance in the dataset efficiently.   
While all class balancing techniques increased the model’s sensitivity to minority classes, they did so at the cost 
of introducing more misclassifications in the majority class and therefore reducing the precision.

This could be due to several factors:

- Complex, potentially non-linear relationships among the predictors that Logistic Regression fails to capture.
- Severe class imbalance, which continues to impact performance despite various balancing strategies.
- The algorithm may have reached its full potential given the constraints of this dataset.

## Dependencies

- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `imblearn`
- `bayesian-optimization` (for BayesSearchCV)

## Future Work

Future exploration will include more advanced classification algorithms, such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, to further address class imbalance and improve predictive accuracy if possible.
